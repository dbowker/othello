Log of work:

Pre   - Many hours of contemplating structure and logic of how to program the game.

Day 1 - Spent coding the basic game.  I have done this portion in many different ways, 
(2 hrs) but this is the first time doing it with a one-dimensional array.  Typically
        I use a 2-d matrix of structures with color and an eight element array with 
        pointers to each neighbor.

Day 2 - Planned out the method of passing the data around.  I
(5 hrs) figured it would be easier on paper than trying to code it in one shot.
        
        Also worked on getting environment configured to use NetBeans on Ubuntu with 
        MPI.
        
Day 3 - Completed single process single level of logic and setup the structure for an 
(6 hrs) infrastructure to handle multiple process

Day 4 - Setup multi processing for multiple levels of think-a-head.  Have most of it
(8 hrs) working, but not everything.
