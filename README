Log of work:
Day 1 - Spent coding the basic game.  I have done this portion in many different ways, 
        but this is the first time doing it with a one-dimensional array.  Typically
        I use a 2-d matrix of structures with color and an eight element array with 
        pointers to each neighbor.

Day 2 - Spent about 5 hours planning out the method of passing the data around.  I
        figured it would be easier on paper than trying to code it in one shot.
        
        Also worked on getting environment configured to use NetBeans on Ubuntu with 
        MPI.
